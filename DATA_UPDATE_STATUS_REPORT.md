## üîß IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### **Next Steps for Soccer Data**
1. **Implement Alternative APIs**:
   - football-data.org (free tier: 10 requests/minute)
   - API-Sports (free tier: 100 requests/day)
   - The Odds API (already configured)

2. **Update Download Script**:
   - Add fallback API sources
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Create hybrid data collection

3. **Production Deployment**:
   - Current system functional with sample data
   - Can operate while implementing real data sources
